### AdditionsMC Fabric

This is AdditionsMC from https://github.com/Poco-Studios/AdditionsMC, 
but ported to Fabric for better support and compatibility!

We're sorry to say that AdditionsMC Forge is no longer supported, at least until MCreator 2021 comes out with support for 1.16.5.

The items in AdditionsMC Fabric are going to be very different from those in AdditionsMC Forge (as that was originally a joke).

It's server-side compatible this time!

# How to Use (Requires medium computer skills, e.g. opening hidden folders, browsing to system directories)

1. Download AdditionsMC Fabric, ModMenu, the Fabric API and Fabric loader from the releases page or CurseForge (Coming Soon!).

2. Follow the instructions on the Fabric site (https://fabricmc.net) to install Fabric.

3. Copy AdditionsMC, ModMenu and the Fabric API to the mods folder.

4. Start minecraft and click on the "Mods" button. If it is not there or AdditionsMC does not show up, check your mods folder. 

5. You're all set!
